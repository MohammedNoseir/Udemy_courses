This project analyzes a dataset of Udemy courses, focusing on key metrics like subscribers, reviews, pricing, and content duration. It includes:

Data Exploration & Visualization: Loading and cleaning the dataset, deriving features (e.g., year, month, profit = price Ã— subscribers), categorizing prices/durations, and creating interactive plots (e.g., monthly profits by year) using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
Recommendation System: A content-based ML model using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity on cleaned course titles to recommend similar courses (e.g., suggesting JavaScript courses for a jQuery query).
Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), text processing (NeatText), and Jupyter Notebooks.

The goal is to uncover insights into course performance and provide personalized recommendations to enhance user engagement on platforms like Udemy.
